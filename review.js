"meaning":"Agreements often incorporate some language which likely relieves a party (or parties) of obligations in the event of an unforeseen event",
"approach":["This type of language is fairly common as it's unreasonable to expect parties to comply with their obligations where they're affected by unforeseen issues."],
"clientTip":["Check to see if the clause is appropriately scoped in terms of the events which would give rise to a release of obligations","You should ensure the supplier at least uses reasonable endeavours to recommence performance within a reasonable time", "You probably want a termination right if the supplier fails to recommence performance within a reasonable number of days"],
"supplierTip":"You might want to think about ensuring that payment obligations are carved out of the release from obligations by the client",
"noReference":"This agreement seems to lack a force majeure clause. If you're the customer, this may be a good thing because the supplier can't get out performing its obligations. If you're the supplier, you should think about including one.]
